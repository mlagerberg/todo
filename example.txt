--------------------------------------

Tue 19 May
[ ] This task is open
[v] With a checkmark (v), the task is completed
[x] Crossed out with an x means: this task is canceled
[~] A squigly line means the task is almost done, partly done, or good enough.
[?] With a question mark, it is not certain if the task should be done or not. Up to you!
[!] Exclamation mark? Superduper important! Do this first or perish!
[ ] Each task can have subtasks as well:
	- with a simple dash, as a bullet point of sorts
	v of course that dash can be changed into a checkmark
	x or a cross, if canceled
	~ a tilde
	? or a question mark however you see fit
	! and again an exclamation for emphasis
[x] The checkmark in the main task
	v (when using sublime text)
	- it crosses all subtasks too
[v] And completing the main task
	- completes the subtask
	x completely
	~ tilde, x or none: all the same
	! even important ones
[~] But partially completing the main task
	- highlights the open subtasks in yellow
	v and completes only the closed subtasks
	! and keeps the important ones
