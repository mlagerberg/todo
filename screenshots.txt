=== TO DO for 2021 ===

[ ] have fun
[ ] separate each week, or month, or day, etc. with a line of dashes:

-------------------------------------

[ ] ignore the length of the line
[ ] anything over 3 characters will highlight





=== sample_main.png ===

[ ] This task is open
[v] With a checkmark (v), the task is completed
[x] Crossed out with an x means: this task is canceled
[~] A squigly line: partly done, 'good enough', finished but untested, etc.
[?] With a question mark, it is not certain if the task is still relevant. Skip it?
[!] Exclamation marks make everything at least twice as important.





=== sample_subtask_state.png ===

[x] Canceling the main task
	v (when using Sublime Text)
	- crossed out all subtasks too
[v] And completing the main task
	- completes the subtasks
	x completely
	~ whether done, crossed, or open.
[~] But partially completing the main task
	- highlights the open tasks in yellow
	v and completes only the closed subtasks






=== sample_subtask.png ===

[ ] Each task can have subtasks as well:
	- with a simple dash, as a bullet point of sorts
	v of course that dash can be changed into a checkmark
	x or a cross, if canceled
	~ a tilde when partially done
	? or a question mark
	! or exclamation, however you see fit.
