# Installation instructions for VSCode

The syntax highlighter is not in the VSCode package library.

On macOS/Linux, copy the entire `todo-highlighter` folder to `~/.vscode/extensions`.

On Windows, copy the entire `todo-highlighter` folder to `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`.

Open a `.txt` file in VSCode, you should see an option to select your syntax highlighting extension from the language mode selector in the bottom right corner of the editor window.
